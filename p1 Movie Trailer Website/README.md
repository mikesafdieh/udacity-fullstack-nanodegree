# Movie Trailer Website
A simple webpage that displays the covers of a few of my favorite movies. When a cover is clicked, the trailer for that movie opens and plays on the page.

This is the first project of Udacity's Fullstack Nanodegree. The goal is to learn the basics of Object Oriented Programing in Python. The `freshtomatoes.py` file was provided by Udacity to generate the webpage (`freshtomatoes.html`) with the movies. You can see their original repo [here](https://github.com/adarsh0806/ud036_StarterCode).

## Download 
To download this project, just clone it by running 

`git clone https://github.com/mikesafdieh/udacity-fullstack-nanodegree.git` 

in the desired directory, or by by downloading the zip file by clicking in the green "Clone or download" button on the top-right of the repo.

**NOTE**: You will need to have Python (2.7 or higher) installed to run the program. If you don't already have it (should come built-in on Mac), download it [here](https://www.python.org/).

## Usage
Once downloaded, simply navigate to the directory with the project on run `python entertainment_center.py`. Your default browser will then open to the webpage. Enjoy :)
