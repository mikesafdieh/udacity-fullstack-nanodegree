# Movie Trailer Website
A simple webpage that displays the covers of a few of my favorite movies. When a cover is clicked, the trailer for that movie opens and plays on the page.

This is the first project of Udacity's Fullstack Nanodegree. The goal is to learn the basics of Object Oriented Programing in Python. The `freshtomatoes.py` file was provided by Udacity to generate the webpage (`freshtomatoes.html`) with the movies. You can see their original repo [here](https://github.com/adarsh0806/ud036_StarterCode).
