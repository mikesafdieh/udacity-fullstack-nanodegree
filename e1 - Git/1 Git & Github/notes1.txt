diff -u old_game.js new_game.js

- shows the difference between 2 files
- -u is the "uniform" flag, it just makes things easier
- the 2nd file given as an argument is the file shown with all the differences (new_game.js in this case)


git diff <commit_id_1> <commit_id_2>

- works the same as diff just that its done with git commits.


git log --stat

- gives a log of each commit 
- the --stat flag also gives statistics of each file that was changed in each commit log 


git config --global color.ui auto

- changes the color to show red for deleted lines and green for added lines


git checkout <commit_id>

- switches to the previous version specified
